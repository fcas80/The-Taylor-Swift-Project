The Taylor Swift Project   <p>

This project attempts to mathematically analyze:<br>
1.  her attractiveness, <br>
2.  her lipstick shades, and <br>
3.  her lyrics.  <br>
Each part contains a considerable amount of imprecision in measuremenys and judgments.
This is more of a work in progress than the final word.  Nevertheless, I think it is a
non-routine use of math, and it was a lot of fun. <p>

There are 3 R files<br>

file 1 of 3:  lovely.txt   <br>
file 2 of 3:  lipsticks.txt   <br>
file 3 of 3:  lyrics.txt   <br>

Most of the remaining files are png image files   <br>
except lem_replacements_df.csv   <br>
